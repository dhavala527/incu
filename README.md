Discovery platform through virtual incubators

It's a web application, where Innovators & Investors come together under the shade of this platform. 
And our Application provides the Innovators all the facilities a normal physical Incubator provide.

My role involved asking several questions to users, data-mining users options against sample datasets & 
giving suggestions according to the mining results obtained so that the business could be scaled to a larger extent.
